## Description
This app is reminiscent of Stack Exchange, designed mainly for homework help. Unlike current platforms, our app does not have restrictions for duplicate or ambiguous questions (to make it more user-friendly) but will retain the upvote-downvote system. To prevent the discouraging of people asking questions due to fear of being ‘downvoted’, we’ll implement a system reminiscent of the Peer-wise mandating justification for anyone downvoting.
